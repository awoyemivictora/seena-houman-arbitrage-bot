1. Initialize Logging:
   - Set up a logging system to capture bot activity and errors.

2. Load Configuration:
   - Import environment variables from a `.env` file.
   - Fetch API keys, secret keys, and other constants (e.g., trade fees, risk percentage, stop-loss, and take-profit).

3. Define WebSocket Client Classes:
   - XTWebsocketClient:
     - Connect to XT.com WebSocket.
     - Subscribe to order book streams.
     - Listen for incoming data and log updates.
   - KuCoin WebSocket Client:
     - Authenticate using API credentials.
     - Subscribe to KuCoin order book streams.
     - Listen for incoming data and log updates.

4. Define Handlers for WebSocket Events:
   - On open: Log the successful connection.
   - On message: Process received data (e.g., update order books).
   - On error: Log errors.
   - On close: Log connection closure.

5. WebSocket Connection:
   - XT.com:
     - Connect to XT.com WebSocket.
     - Subscribe to BTC/USDT market updates.
     - Continuously listen for depth updates and update the local order book.
   - KuCoin:
     - Connect to KuCoin WebSocket.
     - Subscribe to BTC/USDT market updates.
     - Continuously listen for depth updates and update the local order book.

6. Data Processing:
   - Parse and store bids and asks from WebSocket messages into local order book structures for XT and KuCoin.

7. Heartbeat Mechanism:
   - Send periodic "ping" messages to WebSocket servers to keep connections alive.

8. Balance Retrieval:
   - Fetch account balances from both exchanges using their respective APIs.

9. Spread Calculation:
   - For each update in order books:
     - Calculate the highest bid on one exchange and the lowest ask on the other.
     - Include trading fees in the calculation to compute an adjusted spread.
     - Log the spread.

10. Detect Arbitrage Opportunities:
    - Check if the adjusted spread exceeds a predefined threshold.
    - If so, initiate trading logic.

11. Execute Trades:
    - XT.com:
      - Place a limit buy order for BTC/USDT at the best available price.
    - KuCoin:
      - Place a limit sell order for BTC/USDT at the best available price.

12. Risk Management:
    - Calculate position size based on available balance and predefined risk percentage.
    - Set stop-loss and take-profit orders based on entry price.

13. Retry Mechanism:
    - Retry WebSocket connections and trade executions using an exponential backoff strategy.

14. Error Handling:
    - Log all errors and exceptions.
    - Reconnect and retry as necessary.

15. Start Bot:
    - Initialize XT.com and KuCoin WebSocket connections.
    - Fetch initial order book data.
    - Continuously monitor spreads, detect arbitrage opportunities, and execute trades.
