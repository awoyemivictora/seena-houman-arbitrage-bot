Key Observations and Improvements
1. Error Handling:
Current: You’ve added basic try-except blocks for authentication and WebSocket connections.
Improvement:
Log errors to a file for better debugging.
Include retry mechanisms for transient failures, such as WebSocket disconnections.

2. Concurrency:
Current: You’re using asyncio.gather for running the WebSocket listeners concurrently.
Improvement: Add a mechanism to gracefully stop the bot (e.g., handling KeyboardInterrupt) to close WebSocket connections cleanly.

3. Trading Logic:
Current: Basic logic for spread-based trading is implemented.
Improvement:
Implement risk management (e.g., position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit).
Calculate transaction fees for XT.com and KuCoin and incorporate them into the spread calculation.

4. Order Placement:
Current: Basic place_xt_order and place_kucoin_order functions are defined.
Improvement:
Include response validation to ensure orders are executed successfully.
Implement order book synchronization to confirm trade execution.

5. Performance Optimization:
Current: Real-time order book updates are processed.
Improvement: Use debouncing or sampling to reduce the frequency of spread calculations (e.g., every 500ms instead of every update).
