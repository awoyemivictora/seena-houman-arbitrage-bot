# Arbitrage bot to take advantage of price differences between Kucoin and XT.com

To align with the client's requirements for building a trading bot that operates on both KuCoin and XT.com, hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the project:

1. Establish a Robust Connection to Both Exchanges
- Ensure the WebSocket connections to both XT.com and KuCoin are stable and continuously monitored.
- Use heartbeats (ping/pong) to maintain live connections.
- Implement reconnection logic to handle unexpected disconnections.
2. Retrieve and Process Market Data
= XT.com:
 - Ensure the bot is subscribed to the relevant trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT).
 - Process order book updates in real-time.
= KuCoin:
  - Confirm the subscription to depth events (e.g., /market/depth5).
 - Process the bid and ask updates for spread calculation or trading logic.
3. Implement Core Trading Logic
Arbitrage Opportunities:
Use the spread calculated between XT.com and KuCoin to identify potential arbitrage opportunities.
Trade Execution:
Implement order placement for both exchanges via their REST APIs.
Include options for both market orders and limit orders based on trading strategy.
4. Handle Authentication and API Rate Limits
Ensure the bot complies with API rate limits for both XT.com and KuCoin to avoid bans or restrictions.
Use proper authentication mechanisms (e.g., API key, secret key, passphrase).
5. Incorporate Risk Management
Position Sizing:
Add logic to calculate trade size based on available balances and risk parameters.
Stop Loss and Take Profit:
Implement automatic stop-loss and take-profit levels.
Delta-Neutral Hedging:
If applicable, add delta-neutral hedging strategies across both exchanges.
6. Test and Debug Trading Execution
Use paper trading or testnet environments for KuCoin and XT.com to validate:
Order placement.
Order cancellation.
Order fills.
Debug WebSocket and REST API data mismatches.
7. Enhance the Bot's Features
Profit/Loss Tracking:
Track all executed trades and calculate profit/loss.
Notifications:
Send real-time updates to the client via Telegram or email (e.g., trade executed, connection lost).
8. Deploy and Monitor the Bot
Set up the bot on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) for continuous operation.
Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track uptime, performance, and logs.
Ensure proper error logging and notification in case of issues.
